.SH SYNOPSIS
.B jackrec
\-f filename \-d seconds [ \-b bitdepth ] port1 [ port2 ... ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B jackrec is a basic, but useful, audio recorder that will record
audio from 1 or more JACK ports to a file on disk. The file format is
always RIFF/WAV, with samples stored as signed integers. The sample
bit depth can be selected using the \fI-b\fR option. The file will
have as many channels as there are ports specified on the command line
- each channel will contain the data recorded from one port. The user
should generally specify the duration (in seconds) using the \fI-d\fR
option. If not specified, jackrec will record until terminated by a
signal (eg. from Ctrl-c).
.PP
This application is not intended to be a heavy duty audio recorder,
and originated as an example client to show how to handle threading
and disk I/O in a JACK client. However, it is a useful, simple
recorder and is included in the JACK toolkit as a result.
