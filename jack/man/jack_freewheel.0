.TH JACK_FREEWHEEL "1" "!DATE!" "!VERSION!"
.SH NAME
jack_freewheel \- JACK toolkit client to control freewheeling mode
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B jack_freewheel [y|n]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B jack_freewheel
Turns freewheeling mode on (y) or off (n). While in freewheeling mode,
the JACK server does not wait in between process() calls, and does not
read or write data from/to any audio interface. That results in the JACK graph
processing data as fast as possible. Freewheeling makes fast exports to 
files possible.
.PP
There is no useful reason to use this tool other than testing. JACK
clients that use freewheeling will turn it on and off themselves.
